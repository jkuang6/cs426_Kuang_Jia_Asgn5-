I added more collision cubes to make the game more interesting. Add those cubes makes the game more hectic and unpredictable. I also adding some music and the billboard to further enhance the theme of my game. I added the purple and the blue light to make the game livelier and the floor panels look more sophisticaed. Overall, I think the things I added made my game more fun and interesting to play.

Physics Construct: 
  1. Collision with the red cube turns the billboard/video on and off to give a player to remove the music if it gets annoying
  2. Collision with the big cubes reflect players backwards and increases the chances of hitting a gavity cube to make game more hectic.

Billboard:
  1. Since my first project uses a albedo as a texture, I added a video as the texture this time and used it on a billbaord. 
     The video texture matches the game concept of running cats.
   
Lights:
  1. Added a blue spotlight on one side of the cube to give a livelier feel
  2. Added a pink spotlight on the other side of the cube to give a livelier feel

Sound:
  1. Bouncing sound plays on collision with large cube to gives an cue to players
  2. Space sound plays on collision with the reverse gravity cubes to give cue of movement
  3. The billboard plays a song to make the game feel more upbeat
