I added more collision cubes to make the game more interesting. Add those cubes makes the game more hectic and unpredictable. I also adding some music and the billboard to further enhance the theme of my game. I added the purple and the blue light to make the game livelier and the floor panels look more sophisticaed. Overall, I think the things I added made my game more fun and interesting to play.

Physics Construct: 
  1. Collision with the red cube turns the billboard/video on and off
  2. Collision with the big cubes reflect players backwards

Billboard:
  1. Since my first project uses a albedo as a texture, I added a video as the texture this time and used it on a billbaord. 
     The video texture matches the game concept of running cats.
   
Lights:
  1. Added a blue spotlight on one side of the cube
  2. Added a pink spotlight on the other side of the cube

Sound:
  1. Bouncing sound plays on collision with large cube
  2. Space sound plays on collision with the reverse gravity cubes
  3. The billboard plays a song
